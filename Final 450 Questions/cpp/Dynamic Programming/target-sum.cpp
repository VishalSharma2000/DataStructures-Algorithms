/* Given a set of numbers, we have to assign + or - sign at the front of each element such that the final sum of the complete array is equal to the given target sum.

So, by observation after assigning the sign in front of all nos we will have some nos as positive and some as negative. So, basically the array will get divided into two nos one will all +vs nos and other with -ve. Doing the sum of these nos is same as finding the difference between two subsets.

So, the problem reduces to count the pair of subsets with given difference */
