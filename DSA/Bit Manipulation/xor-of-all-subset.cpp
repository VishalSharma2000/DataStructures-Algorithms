/* Given an array of elements find the xor of all the elements of the subset of the array */
/* Answer will be always zero because the same elements are repeated again and again in the subsets */
/* And each element is repeated intotal of 2^n times including all the subset if n is the size of the array which is even 
 so xor of same number even number of times will give answer zero and odd number times will be the same number */
